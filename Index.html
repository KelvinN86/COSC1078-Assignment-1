<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<br>

<p>Hello, my name is Kelvin Nguyen, my student ID is s3946309,
  and I can be contacted through my RMIT email, which is s3946309@student.rmit.edu.au.</p>
<p>I am currently 18 years old, studying a Bachelor course in
  Information Technology after completing year 12 and VCE at Mazenod College in 2021.</p>
<p>I was born in Melbourne Victoria in 2003, after both my parents fled Vietnam through a refugee camp in Malaysia.
  My family consists of my mother, father, and my older sister and a cat that the family adopted last year. Both my parents are Vietnamese,
  and the entire household mainly speaks Vietnamese, but my sister and I only know how to speak the language.</p>

<h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
<br>

<h3>How my Interest Began</h3>
<p>My interest in IT sparked from a very young age through the use of technology such as a home desktop computer and tablets, which has extended into today as now I own and maintain a custom built pc.</p>
<p>The use of different kinds of programs and gaming has also greatly contributed to my growing interest in IT, specifically in the coding/programming side of it. I’ve started playing video games at a very young age starting with games on the Playstation 2, the Wii, and flash games, and ever since I have told myself that “I want to make my own game”.</p>
<p>Although I continued gaming through services such as Steam, I eventually lost the interest I had in developing my own game, this was until I decided to pick and study software development and data analytics in year 10, 11, and 12, which has mainly taught me how to code in Visual Basic and use Microsoft Excel and databases.</p>
<p>Now whenever I use programs or play games, I can find myself sometimes wondering how the backend system of it was developed, this and studying IT subjects helped reinvigorate my old passion in creating a game, I would one day hope to gain the necessary skills to start independently developing and maintaining a game that is competitive in nature as a side/passion project.</p>
<br>

<h3>Why I Chose to Study at RMIT</h3>
<p>The reason why I chose to study at RMIT is because I wanted to pursue interest in IT and expand my current knowledge of IT to eventually work a job in the IT industry, especially one that is coding based. So I saw the Bachelor of Information Technology course as a necessary step for me to take to expand my horizons in the field and eventually reach my goals.</p>
<br>

<h3>What I Expect to Learn During my Studies</h3>
<p>During my studies, I hope to learn the skills needed to step into and work in the IT industries, this includes coding, knowledge of databases and systems, Designs that assist users of systems, and general knowledge that will be useful when working with technology.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

<img src="Seek_Job.jpg" alt="Job Webpage" class="center">
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56416967?type=promoted#sol=44c82e81f506d942670649792dfa445b545bfdff">Job Site Link</a>

<h3>Why this Job Appeals to me</h3>

<p>This is a senior full stack developer for the Seek website itself that appeals to me. I found this job intriguing because it is a position for a full stack developer, this means that I would be working on the back end server side of the website as well as the front end client sides as well. The job is also based in Melbourne, offers a full time placement, and has pay from $140k to $160k per year, which is appealing to me.</p>
<p>Because the job requires the ability to be a full stack developer, this means that I am required to have in depth senior level skills in coding, specifically in TypeScript/JavaScript, Node, HTML/CSS and React, have skills in data bases such as AWS experience and knowledge in Cloud deployment for back end development, and knowledge in user centred design for front end development.</p>
<p>Currently I only have skills in basic programming in Python, and Visual basic, some knowledge in Excel and Databases, and what I have learnt so far in Intro to Information Technology, Introduction to Programming, Practical Database concepts, and User centred Design.</p>
<p>My plan for working towards this goal is to complete my degree in Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, select the right units to gain the necessary knowledge for this type of job, and then eventually find a job similar to this to work at.</p>

<p>The results of the Myers-Briggs test suggests that I am able to be the mediator between people, as it says that I am open minded about aspects people bring forth.</p>
<p>The learning style test displays that I am geared towards visual learning, meaning I can pick up skills mainly through observation.</p>
<p>The Big 5 Personality test’s top two traits line up with the results of the Myers-Briggs test, showing that I am open and agreeable to others.</p>
<p>These tests suggest that I am able to keep the team I am in on track with the assignment and am able to hear out the opinions of others when working and before making a decision rather than always relying on myself. This displays that I am capable of working with the majority of people I will be matched up with.</p>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<br>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The project that I would like to develop is an easily configurable, customisable and modifiable inventory sorter that can be accessed on both a computer/laptop and a mobile device which are both synced together via cloud system. The purpose this application will serve is to have an easy to use tool where you could easily track the inventory of anything, whether it be personal belongings in a house, groceries, or even the stock of items in a warehouse. The application is able to be synced to multiple devices such as another computer or mobile devices so that changes can be made on the fly, such as checking what supplies are low in your home when you are at a store so you know what to purchase. </p>
<br>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>This project will be interesting and useful, because it can serve as a productivity tool and a quality of life tool, designed so that you could organise your belongings and update the stock level of it easily to know what items in a household is low on at the moment, which may inform you to restock.</p>
<br>

<h3>Description</h3>
<h4>Goal:</h4>
<p>This product is designed to cleanly keep track of the inventory stock of anything and will be easily configurable, customisable, and modifiable.</p>
<br>
<h4>Functionality:</h4>
<p>The functionality of this product will be the ability to create an inventory or multiple if they choose to, then populate it with a list of items that the user will name, and assign amounts to each of them, the user will also be able to add descriptions to the items such as the current location of the item, ID of item, and etc.</p>
<br>
<h4>Configurability:</h4>
<p>The user is able to configure the list of items any way they want in the form of sorting by a filter, such as sorting items alphabetically, by stock amount from low to high or high to low. The user will also be able to configure the view of the inventory, such as having it in different types of list views, or gridded views.</p>
<br>
<h4>Customisability, and Modifiability:</h4>
<p>The user is able to customise and modify the application to look however they want, examples of such are the ability to add icons to items, assign icons to multiple inventories, change text colour, change background colour/image.</p>
<br>
<h4>User Interface:</h4>
<p>The user interface will be minimal and easy to follow/use, steps will be taken to make sure that the user interface is not cluttered so that it does not affect the user experience negatively. The user interface also comes into consideration when designing the configurability, customisability and modifiability of the product.</p>
<br>
<h4>User Data and Security:</h4>
<p>To use this application users are required to create an account using their email and creating a username and password, the email address will be used for two factor authentication. The email address is the only required personal information the product collects from its users. All the account data will be stored using a cloud service and data stored and received will be required to be encrypted using a form of data encryption. Besides the email address, other data will include the additions and changes the user has made within the product itself, the inventory, the names and descriptions of items, the items itself and images uploaded is also confidential to the user, so all data interacting with this product must also be encrypted.</p>
<br>
<h4>Usage on Multiple Devices and Syncing:</h4>
<p>To allow the product to sync to multiple devices such as another desktop or mobile devices, a cloud service is needed to achieve the result. When designing both the desktop application and mobile application, effort will be made to make them both as similar in design as possible to make the user experience as fluid as possible.</p>
<br>
<h4>Automation:</h4>
<p>The user will be able to optionally set automatic mechanisms in the application such as an automatic notification with or without sound that notifies the user when a set item reaches a set amount.</p>
<br>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<h4>The equipment required:</h4>
<p>Computers to develop the product on, and computers and mobile devices to test the product on when developing it.</p>
<br>
<h4>The software required:</h4>
<p>An integrated development system that supports Python 3, such as PyCham, Visual Studio Code and Atom.</p>
<p>A cloud hosting service for applications to store user data such as Back4App, Heroku, or Firebase.</p>
<p>Github is required for group members to collaborate and work on the project.</p>
<p>A way for group members to meet online such as Microsoft Teams, or Discord
A tool used to create wireframe prototypes such as Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch.</p>
<p>An application designing tool for frameworks such as MIT App Inventor, BuildFire.js, or Framework 7.</p>
<p>Services that provide collaboration and communication such as Microsoft Teams, Discord, and Google Drive</p>
<br>

<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>The skills that are required for this project would be the ability to code in the Python 3 coding language, as it will serve to develop the back end of both the desktop and mobile application. Group members will need the ability to create prototype wireframes with tools, the ability to create suitable user interfaces for the application with tools, the ability to host data on cloud services with encryption and the ability to thoroughly test the application for possible fixes.</p>
<p>The skills listed are achievable as these skills are taught in the IT units and can also be self taught.</p>
<br>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>For the outcome to be successful, the prototype, development, and testing phases of the project must be met. If all stages of the project are met, then the outcome of the product will be a working and convenient inventory sorter that is easily configurable, customisable and modifiable to the user’s needs.</p>
